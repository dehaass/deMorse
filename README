# deMorse
A PlatformIO project using a Raspberry Pi Pico and a morse key (or any switch) to emulate a full keyboard and mouse. The project started out as an interesting way to learn and practise morse but accidentally turned into a project with accessibility applications. 

Many of the morse commands come from a project designed for a quadriplegic: https://makoa.org/jlubin/morsecode.htm
